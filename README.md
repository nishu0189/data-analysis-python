# Data Analysis with Python 🐍

Welcome to my **Data Analysis with Python** repository!  
This project is part of my learning journey toward mastering Python for data-related tasks.

## 📁 Notebook: `new_python.ipynb`

In this notebook, I’ve covered and demonstrated **core Python concepts** that form the foundation of data analysis and real-world problem-solving.

### 🔹 Topics Covered:
- String operations and built-in functions
- Loops (for, while)
- Exception handling using `try` / `except`
- Random module: `random.randint()`
- Function behavior:
  - Call by Value
  - Call by Reference
- Shallow vs Deep Copy:
  - `copy.copy()`
  - `copy.deepcopy()`
- Dictionary operations:
  - `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.items()`
  - `.get()` and `.setdefault()`

## 💡 Purpose

This notebook is part of my effort to build a **strong foundation** in Python by actively coding key features, testing behavior, and practicing hands-on logic.

## 🔜 Upcoming

More notebooks coming soon on:
- Os and file System
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Real-world case studies

Stay tuned! 🌱
